# 3. Business management requirements

> ##          3.1 Business environment

The business environment for the web application will be the academic and professional community of the Software Engineering club and its members. This community is likely to be tech-savvy and in need of a centralized resource for information on internship opportunities.

> ##          3.2 Mission, goals, and objectives

 The mission of the web application is to provide registered members of the Software Engineering club with a comprehensive and up-to-date repository of internship opportunities and to host an event system that keeps members informed and engaged with the club.

 Goals and Objectives:

 - To provide a centralized repository of current internship opportunities with live updates on availability.
 - To allow registered members to save individual opportunities to their personalized profile for later viewing.
 - To host an event system that alerts users of updates to the repository and other club events.
 - To provide a user-friendly and accessible interface for members to access the repository and event system.
 - To protect user information and data through a secure login process.

> ##          3.3 Business model

 The web application will be developed and maintained by a software developer, with support from club administrators. Access to the repository and event system will be restricted to registered members of the Software Engineering club, who will be required to log in to the system. The application will be hosted on a web server, with a database to store information about members, internship opportunities, and events.

> ##          3.4 Information environment

 The information environment for the web application will consist of the data stored in the database, including information about members, internship opportunities, and events. This data will be accessible through the user-facing interface and the administrative interface. The event system will provide alerts to users about updates to the repository or other club events, and the repository will provide access to current internship opportunities with live updates on availability.

> ##          4.2. Business operational policies and rules

 - Access to the web application will be restricted to registered members of the Software Engineering club.
 -  User data and information will be protected through a secure login process.
 -  The internship opportunity repository will be updated regularly to ensure its accuracy and relevance.
 -  The event system will be used to keep members informed about updates to the repository and other club events.
 -  Club administrators will be responsible for managing the repository of internship opportunities and events.

> ##          4.3. Business operational constraints

 - The web application will require an internet connection to access the repository and receive notifications from the event system.
 -  The system will be dependent on the reliability of the web server and database hosting the application.
 -  Technical support will be required to address any issues with the functionality of the website or system.

> ##          4.4. Business operational modes

 - Normal Operation: The web application will be available for registered members to access the repository and event system through a standard web browser.
 -  Maintenance Mode: The web application may be taken offline temporarily for maintenance or upgrades.
 -  Failure Mode: In the event of a failure, such as a server outage, the web application may be unavailable.

> ##          4.5. Business operational quality

 The operational quality of the web application will be measured by the following factors:

 -  User satisfaction: Feedback from members about the functionality and usefulness of the repository and event system.
 -  Data accuracy: The accuracy of the information in the repository of internship opportunities.
 -  System availability: The uptime of the web application, including the server and database hosting the application.

# 5. Preliminary operational concept of proposed system


> ## 5.1. Preliminary operational concept

>> ### a) operational policies and constraints

 The web application is restricted to students who have registered with the Software Engineering Club.
Access to the repository will be limited to these students.
The web application must provide a secure and reliable platform for repository access.
Community updates and club events must be visible to all students.
All data security protocols must be met for storing repository information.

 Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) will be important in this case, since the individuals whose information that is being stored are students. FERPA outlines regulations regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of student data; it also outlines students' rights to access and update their educational records.

>> ### b) description of the proposed system

 The proposed web application will provide students the ability to access a repository of information regarding internships for software engineering, but only those who are members of the Software Engineering Club will be allowed access. The web application will provide users with community updates, such as new content posted on the web application and upcoming club events. It will also provide users with a simple and intuitive interface that is easy to use.

>> ### c) modes of system operation

 - User-facing interface for members to access the internship opportunity repository and event system.
 - Administrative interface for managing the repository and events.

>> ### d) user classes and other involved personnel

 - Registered Members of the Software Engineering club, who will have access to the repository and event system.
 - Club Administrators, who will be responsible for managing the repository and events.

>> ### e) support environment.

 - The web application will be accessible through a standard web browser.
 - The application will require an internet connection to access the repository and receive notifications about events.
 - The system will be hosted on a web server, with a database to store information about members, internship opportunities, and events.
 - Technical support will be provided by the developer, or an assigned administrator, for issues with the website or system functionality.

> ## 5.2. Preliminary operational scenarios

 A typical usage scenario would involve a student logging into the web application, selecting the repository option from the menu, and then selecting the desired internship for more information. They would then be able to view the requirements and details of the internship, and may decide to apply for it by submitting their application via the web application.

# 6. Other preliminary life-cycle concepts


> ## 6.1 Preliminary acquisition concept

 The system solution will be acquired using a combination of stakeholder engagement, requirements definition, solicitation and contracting, design, production, and verification

> ## 6.2 Preliminary deployment concept

 The system solution will be validated, delivered, and introduced into operations through a series of tests and quality assurance measures. A beta testing period with selected members of the Software Engineering Club will be carried out prior to full deployment.

> ## 6.3 Preliminary support concept

 A support infrastructure will be required for the successful operation of the system, including operating support, engineering support, maintenance support, supply support, and training support.

> ## 6.4 Preliminary retirement concept

 When the web application is no longer needed or is considered out of date, it will be removed from operation and retired. Any hazardous materials used in or resulting from the process will be disposed of appropriately.

# 7. Project Constraints

 Project constraints include the tight timeline due to the limited amount of time before the semester's end, limited resources allocated to the project, and the need to make sure the project meets all necessary legal and regulatory requirements.
